Implementation of Apriori Algorithm using Python

## Apriori Algorithm
Apriori Algorithm is a Machine Learning algorithm which is used to gain insight into the structured relationships between different items involved. The most prominent practical application of the algorithm is to recommend products based on the products already present in the userâ€™s cart.

## Apriori Principle
If an itemset is infrequent, then all of its supersets must also be infrequent

### The dataset used is as follows
<table align="center">
  <tr>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Riyanshi243/1913075_IT401/blob/main/dmw_dataset.png" alt="dataset" style="width:200px;height:420px;"></td>
  </tr>
 </table>

### The minimum support provided is - 60%

### Final Frequent Set of the above dataset is
### [('A', 'B', 'D', 'F'), ('A', 'B', 'E', 'F'), ('B', 'D', 'E', 'F'), ('C', 'D', 'E', 'F')]
